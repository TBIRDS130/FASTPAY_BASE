/**
 * SmsService - Required for app to be set as default SMS app
 * 
 * This service allows the app to be selected as the default SMS app.
 * When set as default, the app receives SMS broadcasts more reliably
 * and with higher priority, which helps with bulk message handling.
 * 
 * The actual SMS processing is handled by SmsReceiver, which uses
 * optimized batching to prevent slowdowns with large message volumes.
